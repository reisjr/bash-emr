========

This is a simple set of bash functions for manipulating
Amazon Elastic MapReduce clusters.

Install
-----

You must install the [AWS Command Line Interface](http://aws.amazon.com/cli/).

You then must setup an emr_defaults.json file with your default emr settings.

Either call:

    aws configure set key-name <your key name> [--profile <profile-name>]
    aws configure set key-pair-file <path to private key>  [--profile <profile-name>]

Or, use the emr_defaults_sample.json as a starting point:

    export EMR_DEFAULTS_JSON=/<mypath>/bash-emr/bash-emr/emr_defaults.json

Finally, you must source the `setenv.sh` file (in your .bash_profile)

. /<mypath>/bash-emr/setenv.sh

Usage
-----

To find an existing cluster:

  emrlist

To attach to a cluster, using a _flow id_:

  emrset <flow id>

To get the current _flow id_:

  emrset

To remotely login to the master node of the current _flow id_:

  emrlogin

To remotely login with just the ip address:

  emrlogin <ip address>

Note that most commands will take the _cluster id_ or an _ip address_ to
override the default _cluster id_ set using `emrset`.

Reference
---------

### emr
This is shorthand for calling from the shell.

    emr <some args>

### emrhelp
List the main commands available on bash-emr.

    emrhelp

### emrcreate

Will start a dev cluster using the configuration on the emr_defaults.json file. If the file
is not correctly defined, the cluster start will fail.
    
    emrcreate <cluster-name>

### emrset
When you start a flow on EMR, you will be given a flow id.
Use __emrset__ to set the flow id for use by many of the other commands

    emrset <flow id>

Calling __emrset__ without the id returns the current flow id.

### emrprofile
Will set the current default profile for the aws cli to use, effectively
changing the keys and credential to be use used on subsequent commands.

Will also set 'AWS_DEFAULT_PROFILE', or unset if there is no profile name
given.


### emrprivip
Will toggle use of private ips vs public domain names. Simply set or unsets
the env var 'EMR_PRIVATE_IPS'.

### emrlist
Will return the list of recent clusters.

### emractive
Will return the list of clusters that in an active state.

### emrhost
Will return the current master node DNS name on the EMR cluster.

If 'priv' is given, will return the current the private ip of the master node
on the EMR cluster.

    emrhost priv

Passing 'priv' to other commands that do a host lookup will force them to
attach via the private ip.

Setting 'EMR_PRIVATE_IPS' to true, will force all commands to use private ips.

### emrlogin
Will remotely login to the master node.

### emrstat
Will return the current status of a given running flow.

### emrterminate
Will terminate your remote EMR cluster.

### emrscreen
Will launch screen on the master node. Screen must be already installed.
If a screen instance is already running, this command will automatically attach.

Note screens will be named after the local username, or use the
`EMR_SCREEN_NAME` env variable.

### emrscreenlist
Will list all remove screen names.

### emrtail
Will automatically 'tail' the current flow step logs.

    emrtail 2

Without a step number, a list of available steps will be displayed.

### emrproxy
Will create a local SOCKS proxy to the master node. This is useful for accessing
the JobTracker and NameNode. You must install FoxyProxy in FireFox for this to
work best.

### emrprint
Will print urls for possible EMR services on the master node.

Passing 'priv' as an argument will create urls using the private ips.

### emrscp
Will scp a given file to the remote master node.

    emrscp my-hadoop-app.jar

This is useful if you leave your EMR cluster running and want to manually spawn
jobs from __emrlogin__ or __emrscreen__.

### emrscplocal
Will copy the given file or folder from the remote master node to a local path

    emrscplocal file.on.master.txt ~/myfolder/

### emrconf
Will scp all `conf/*-site.xml` files from the master node into the given
directory.

    emrconf local-conf

This is useful if you leave your EMR cluster running on a AWS VPC and wish to
run Hadoop jobs from a local shell.
